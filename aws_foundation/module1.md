### CLOUD CONCEPT OVERVIEW
###### This module addresses the following topics:
•Introduction to cloud computing
•Advantages of cloud computing
•Introduction to Amazon Web Services (AWS)
•AWS Cloud Adoption Framework (AWS CAF)

###### Module objectives
After completing this module, you should be able to:
•Define different types of cloud computing modelS
•Describe six advantages of cloud computing
•Recognize the main AWS service categories and core services
•Review the AWS Cloud Adoption Framework (AWS CAF)

##### Cloudcomputing
is the on-demand delivery of compute power, database, storage, applications, and other IT resources via the internetwith pay-as-you-gopricing

Cloud computing enables you to stop thinking of your infrastructure as hardware, and instead think of (and use) it as software. 

###### cloud service models. 
###### •Infrastructure as a service (IaaS):
Services in this category are the basic building blocks for cloud IT and typically provide you with access to networking features, computers (virtual or on dedicated hardware), and data storage space. 

###### •Platform as a service (PaaS): 
Services in this category reduce the need for you to manage the underlying infrastructure (usually hardware and operating systems) and enable you to focus on the deployment and management of your applications. 

###### •Software as a service (SaaS):
Services in this category provide you with a completed product that the service provider runs and manages. 

#### cloud computing deployment models
###### •Cloud:
 A cloud-based application is fully deployed in the cloud, and all parts of the application run in the cloud. Applications in the cloud have either been created in the cloud or have been migrated from an existing infrastructure to take advantage of the benefits of cloud computing .
 ###### •Hybrid: 
 A hybrid deployment is a way to connect infrastructure and applications between cloud-based resources and existing resources that are not located in the cloud. 
 ###### •On-premises:
  Deploying resources on-premises, using virtualization and resource management tools, is sometimes called private cloud.  

##### Advantage of cloud computing
  1.Trade capital expense for variable expense
  2.Benefit from massive economies of scale
  3.Stop guessing capacity•Increase speed and agility
  4.Stop spending money on running and maintaining data centers
  5.Go global in minutes
